trillions follow infrastructure green energy inflation reduction biden despite early warnings former clinton treasury secretary larry summers could lead inflation inflation came biden administration dismissed transitory fact inflation still remains persistently high even fastest interestrate tightening cycle memory result bidens inflation average americans lost roughly fifth purchasing power last years moreover american needs mortgage car loan credit card debt faces much higher interest costs constrain purchasing power different federal government must devote trillion dollars annually interest trillion debt massive sum thats growing trillion dollars every hundred days trajectory unsustainable yet bidens budget calls even higher spending growth already slowed percent last quarter anemic percent first quarter year cant afford another four years bidenomics foreign policy ukraine war president trump left office isis defeated abraham accords signed new wars raging global stage three half
